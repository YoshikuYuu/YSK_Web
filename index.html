    <p>Hi, I'm Josephâ€”though I go by the pseudonym YoshikuYuu on GitHub and other platforms. I'm an undergrad studying biology and computer
      science at UofT. When I'm not messing with yeast genomes or untangling spaghetti code, I like to dabble in creative
      writing and philosophy.</p>
    <p>Hello! This site is under construction at the moment; I'll be adding to it over the next few weeks :&#41;</p>
